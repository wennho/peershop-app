===============================================================================

PeerShop is an application that allows users to easily create for-sale postings
on their phone and share it on the internet with friends and the community.

We have a simple interface for:
- Viewing all postings
- Searching for postings
- User log in
- Item creation (requires user to be logged in)

Documentation of Design Collaboration

1    Background Information

1.1     Project Rationale

As the end of the academic year approaches, graduating students will be seeking
avenues to sell their belongings in a reliable and efficient way. This
PeerShop application is a platform that allows students to post items they wish
to sell, and to also see what their friends are selling based on the contact
list. Items for sale are uploaded to a web server, so that they can be perused
online as well.

1.2     Choice of Collaborator

My collaborator, Sabrina Ng, is one such graduating student. As a member of the
target demographic group, it is hoped that she will bring unique perspectives
to bear on this project, while offering feedback that is largely reflective of
the intended consumer population.


2     The Design Collaboration Process

The collaborative process was enacted through various media such as phone
conversations, email, and face-to-face discussions. Several stages were
involved. First, we talked about the goals of the collaboration and shared what
we think would make good “Features”, incorporating them into the proposal. This
was followed by an incubation period, whereby I began developing the prototype
while Sabrina formulated personal expectations of what the app would look like
without actually seeing the prototype. Once the prototype was created, we
reconvened for a more in-depth discussion. The Sabrina test-used the app and
commented on the aesthetics and user-friendliness of the interface.


2.1     Incorporated Feedback

2.2     Future Work

Based on issues that surfaced during the collaborative process, future work on
the app will entail building in the following functionalities:
- The capability to group, and compare items by category, price,
  location and credibility ratings of the seller, etc.
- Drop-down lists that request specific information (e.g. item condition) from
  the seller when he/she is creating a new post for an item, as opposed to a
  simple description box which may lead to omission of important information
